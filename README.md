## Objective

Practice using HTML tags to structure a content on web pages.

## Exercise 1

Steps are to be completed under the div with `id="exercise1"`

1. Create a **heading 1** element that contains your name between opening and closing tags
2. Create a **paragraph** element that contains a bio about yourself

## Exercise 2

Steps are to be completed under the div with `id="exercise2"`

1. Create an **unordered list** element
2. Create three **list item** elements nested inside of the **unordered list** that your just created
3. Create an **anchor** element inside of _each_ **list item** that you just created in your **unordered list**
4. Each **anchor** element should link to the following:
   - The first **anchor** element should link to your _LinkedIn profile_
   - The second **anchor** element should link to the _TrueCoders homepage_
   - The third **anchor** element should link to your _most visited website_

## Exercise 3

Steps are to be completed under the div with `id="exercise3"`

1. Create an **image** element
2. Add an **src** attribute with a _relative path_ value that points to the `./images/example.png` file
3. Add an **alt** attribute with a _text description_ value of the image

## Exercise 4

Steps are to be completed under the div with `id="exercise4"`

1. Edit the **paragraph** element's text content so that:
   - the word "Bredon" is enclosed in a span element
   - any word "play" is enclosed in an underline element
   - any word "beautiful" is enclosed in an emphasis element
   - any word "point" is enclosed in an strong element

## Exercise 5

Steps are to be completed under the div with `id="exercise5"`

1. Edit the blog post so that more _semantically meaningful_ elements are used instead of generic **division** containers.
   - You will need to use
     - **one main element**
     - **three section elements**
     - **one article element**
     - **one header element**
     - **two nav element**
     - **two unordered list element**
     - **five list item elements**
     - **five anchor elements**
     - **one footer element**
   - To be completed, you should have no more than **three division elements** and **zero span elements** (not including the div with `id="exercise5"`)
